A week ago, a [small phone accessory company tried to claim that Nintendo had infringed on a patent with their console, the Nintendo Switch](https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/01/nintendo-switch-wikipad-gamevice-import-investigation-patent/). They filed a similar patent complaint last year, but it was dropped.

Are the designs similar? Kind of, but one is a clip on to a cell phone and the other is a controller with a screen. I see the claim, but to go up against a successful company like Nintendo won't work. They have a massive share of the American game market and a majority of the international market. Sorry, tiny phone accessory company.
