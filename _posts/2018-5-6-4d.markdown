title: "4D Printing? I don't know her."

[This article](https://www.dezeen.com/2018/04/29/4d-printed-flat-pack-furniture-of-the-future-assembled-heat-carnegie-mellon-university/) about "4D printing" was very interesting. Flat objects are printed using a 3D printer, and then they are placed in hot water, causing the plastic to warp. The process, called thermorph, has allowed researchers to create a number of simple objects, but they hope to use the technology to build flat-packing furniture in the future. As someone interested in industrial design, this seems like a fascinating idea. It could also make for more efficient and lightweight household products that are easy to store. I'm just not sure if they can be flattened again after they are heated.
