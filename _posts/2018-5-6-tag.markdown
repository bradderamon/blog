I didn't notice this tag until two weeks ago, and I've owned this jacket since high school. The design is brilliant. Inside the tag is the security chip sticker. If you don't notice the tag or don't have scissors to cut it off, the jacket cannot be stolen from a store. That is just some incrediblely secure design.
