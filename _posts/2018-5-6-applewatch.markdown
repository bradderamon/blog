[An Apple Watch was credited for saving a man's life last week](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/doctors-say-apple-watch-helped-save-the-life-of-a-32-year-old-man-who-experienced-a-sudden-medical-crisis/ar-AAwGRU0). The device warned the man that his heart rate was at an alarming and recommended that he get medical attention. He was rushed to the hospital by his mother where doctors found that he had an erupted ulcer.

Talk about successful design. Most people probably think about the Watch's heart monitor as an exercise tool, but it saved this man from dying. Technology is powerful, but well-designed technology is life changing.
