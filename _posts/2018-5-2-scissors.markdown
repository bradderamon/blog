title: "Cut-out Scissors"

The other day, my friend told me a story about some scissors she bought at Ikea. I couldn't find an exact picture, but they were packaged like this:

She needed scissors to open her scissors, which she had purchased because she didn't have scissors. Talk about poor design. At some point, this kind of packaging stops being ironic and starts being annoying. 

How do you design packaging for scissors to make them openable without scissors but secure enough to not be stolen out of stores? I'll start brainstorming.
