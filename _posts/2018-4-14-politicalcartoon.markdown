Okay, so two posts about the Facebook drama, but this is more about the trial. How does it relate to design? So many questions during Zuckerberg's Senate hearing were about services we as users already have access to and settings have access to control. It is silly to me that these "political leaders" did not do thorough research into privacy rights on the social media app. Is it a design issue that these people can't find their settings? Maybe, but Facebook is already working on that. More likely, these people didn't think to look for them until they absolutely had to.
