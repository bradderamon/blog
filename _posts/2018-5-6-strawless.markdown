title: "No Straws? No Problem!"

Starbucks needs a little good PR, so why weren't their new [strawless lids](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/8grwpq/starbucks_is_now_offering_strawless_lids/) promoted more? I love the design. It takes the simplicity of a reusable to-go cup and puts it together with the standard plastic cup. Would I rather they stop using single-use plastic cups instead? Yes, but cutting down on straw usage is awesome, nonetheless.
