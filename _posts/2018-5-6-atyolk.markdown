title: "You'll probably find me next semester At Yolk"
---

I read [this article](http://www.adweek.com/creativity/design-army-gives-back-to-d-c-with-a-creative-space-everyone-can-use/) about the firm Design Army and their new project, At Yolk, an all-purpose creative space for the arts, music, food, etc. communities of Washington, D.C. The space is meant to host and cultivate all creative pursuits.

This is exactly what I want to be doing. I love design, but I also enjoy art, music, fashion, you name it. I have always craved a space like this (or like Casey Neistat's "368"), and I would love to help make this space successful. The idea of giving back to the community is wonderful, and the description for the space makes it sound like a dream destination for the creative mind. I cannot wait to check it out in the fall (or maybe in the summer, because I really cannot wait).
