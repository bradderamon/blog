title: "Print Your Tech"
---

This is a very cool [article](https://www.designnews.com/electronics-test/electronics-directly-3d-printed-skin/170542251358682) about the future of printing in the military and medicine. The printer, which is a super accurate, real-time-adjusting machine, uses ink made with silver flakes to print electronics on human skin, which could be used in military combat to detect harmful chemicals or absorb sunlight to power other equipment. The printing tech could also be used to print skin grafts for surgery.

This is crazy. This kind of hyper-advanced technological design is mind-blowing. A chemical sensor on your skin that you can just wash offf when you are done? A printer that creates skin grafts? This kind of technology is revolutionary. My father is a physician, and I think he'd find this fascinating.
