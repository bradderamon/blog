title: "Visual Design of Digital Music"

A friend of mine sent me this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8sMk5KeWvg&feature=youtu.be) the other day. It's about how to make dance electronic music using this one tool. Super interesting video, but a little long. What I liked a lot about it was the use of comedic images and captions to keep viewer interested. The use of a simple sans-serif also made the captions easy to read and did not detract from the comedic value of the captions' content. The video layout with simple, but the entire piece was well-designed.
