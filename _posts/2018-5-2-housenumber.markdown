What is more important: aesthetic quality or practicality?

This is a house number I saw in Georgetown two weeks ago.

Is it unique? Yes. Is it interesting? Definitely.

But if you happen to get hurt on that block, or if you have a similarly designed number (i.e. uses words instead of numerals) and you are in a situation where you need to call 911, authorities will not find you easily.

If a car is speeding past or trying to find a number, this design will not work. It takes longer to process and, therefore, is less accessible in crisis situations.

When it comes down to it, aesthetic quality is not as important as practicality.
