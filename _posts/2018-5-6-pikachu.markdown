The design for Pikachu, the mascot of the Pokémon franchise, was originally [based off a squirrel](https://kotaku.com/pikachu-wasnt-based-on-a-mouse-but-a-squirrel-1825738117). It makes sense when you think about it, but he has since become know as the Electric Mouse Pokémon. I don't like his current design as much as his original, but he does look more squirrel-like now.
