This was a video my mom sent me a few weeks ago, as her former student is the director of operations for the company. Jivanas seems like a terrific business with a noble goal of bringing economic and social revitalization to the Nepalese people. However, aside from the pieces workers were cutting and sanding in the video, there are not available concepts or designs for consumers to look at before deciding to sign up for emails about the shoes. I think adding a sketch or a single prototye shoe image would greatly benefit the marketing of this company. From the little bits you can see in the video, the shoes look very nice. I just want to see a little more.
