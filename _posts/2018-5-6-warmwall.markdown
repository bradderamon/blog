title: "Public Service of a Public Space"

[This project](https://www.dezeen.com/2018/05/05/lauren-lee-warm-wall-alleviate-women-menstrual-cramps/) by a recent graduate of the Master of Industrial Design programme at the Pratt Institute, Lauren Lee. She created a curved, heated wall for women to lean on in the bathroom to alleviate menstrual cramping. The design is simple but seems effective, and I hope it is adopted by public facilities soon.

This is the kind of design I find most inspiring. Lee's project aims to solve a large-scale problem for women by providing physical comfort in a public space as to alleviate the stigma of menstraution as well. It is a great design, and it focuses on how our physical environment can help us in real life. I aspire to design something this creative and great one day.
