[Don't trust a personality test.](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43869911) Facebook applied for a patent to use personality data to profile users and target adverts. If you were worried about web security/pricvacy on Facebook before (thank you Cambridge Analytica), you really haven't seen anything yet. I don't usually take the personality quizzes I see on Facebook, but I sure as heck won't now.
