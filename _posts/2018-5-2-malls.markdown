title: "The Fall of Malls"

I thought this was a very interesting [video](https://www.facebook.com/Vox/videos/870489743138629/?q=vox%20malls). Malls always seemed a little lame when people would ask if I wanted to hang out there.

Malls served as a gathering space for decades, but they were designed with the intent to sell. I'm not surprised that they are closing, but I think something should be designed with the empty space.
