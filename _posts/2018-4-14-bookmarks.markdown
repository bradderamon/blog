title: "Facebook Makes Settings Noticeable"
---

Facebook announced that they would be changing their interface to make settings [easier to find](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/privacy-shortcuts/). Alongside this, they have [redesigned the Bookmarks tab](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/14/facebooks-bookmarks-menu-gets-a-facelift-that-makes-its-settings-easier-to-find/) of their app to make Pages, Groups, and other elements easeir to find and engage with. The update are set to roll out over the next few weeks.

My app has already been updated with these new features, and I am a fan. Settings are definitely easier to access, and it is nice to see all of my pages in a quite-to-access location. A few days before I got this update, I had received a different one with a tab specifically for Groups. I really liked the Groups tab because all of my groups' posts were accessible. I use Facebook more for groups and events than to keep up with "friends," so the Groups tab was key. It will be missed, but at least Bookmarks looks better.
