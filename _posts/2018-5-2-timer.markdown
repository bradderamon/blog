This is another piece of design I saw in the Hillwood Estate. The kitchen in the main house was state-of-the-art for its time, and this timer stuck out to me.

Nowadays, built-in kitchen timers are common; you can find them on ovens, microwaves, and cooktops. However, this egg timer-like contraption shows the earlier iterations and inspirations for current designs. It blends in well with surrounding fixtures, and it demonstrates an efficiency carried into modern appliance and cookware design.
