<img src="/blog/img/do-not-disturb.jpg" alt="A metal do-not-disturb sign on a door.">

This sign was drilled to a bedroom door in the Hillwood estate. I think the concept is pretty smart and makes for efficient design. When it is safe to enter, close the sign. When you want to be left alone, open it. It is more sustainable and eco-friendly than a paper or laminated sign, and it is more tasteful than a sock.
